# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# Distributed Energy Microgrid using Blockchain

The project aims to develop a management system for distributed
energy with the help of distributed ledger technology.
In an attempt to contribute to the Net-Zero Emission by 2050 mission, green renewable
sources of energy are being encouraged. With an increasing number of energy units installed
both at industrial and domestic levels, the effective and efficient distribution of energy
produced is crucial. The project will cater to all these needs while also regulating a
bi-directional trade of energy between multiple parties simultaneously, including power
corporations, households, and individuals. This also encourages more and more individuals to
set up a renewable energy source in their house, as they can sell the surplus energy to nearby
households or corporations. Blockchains enable us to store the digital ownership of physical
goods which can further be extended to the ownership of energy produced by an individual
through various units. Besides, Blockchain can also act as a payment mode for energy
transactions making it convenient to manage.
